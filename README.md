# Model-Evaluation-and-Validation
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and I want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with my peers, I decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist me and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, I have come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. My task is to build an optimal model based on statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.
